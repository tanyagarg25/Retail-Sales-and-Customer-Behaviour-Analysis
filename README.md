# Retail-Sales-and-Customer-Behaviour-Analysis

## **Executive Summary**
**Objective:**
This project aimed to analyze retail sales and customer behavior data to uncover profitability issues, identify key contributing factors, and recommend strategic solutions. The goal was to enable marketing regional managers to address risks and seize opportunities through visual analytics.

**Context:**
The analysis leveraged Tableau to develop an interactive KPI dashboard and a step-by-step storyboard that illustrated insights. Data was prepared using Excel, including creating a lookup table for U.S. regions and divisions to enhance the dataset.

## **Business Problem**
**Problem Identification:** 
The National Sales Company experienced profitability challenges across its regions but lacked clarity on the causes. The organization needed to explore sales and customer data to uncover issues such as pricing structures, product performance, or regional disparities.

**Business Impact:** 
Unaddressed profitability issues risked reduced revenue and competitive standing. Diagnostic and predictive insights were crucial for refining strategies and improving overall profitability.

## **Methodology**

**Excel:** Created a lookup table to categorize U.S. states by regions and divisions using Census Bureau codes, enriching the dataset.

**Tableau:**
* Designed an interactive dashboard to monitor KPIs, enabling managers to identify risks and opportunities within seconds.
* Developed a visual storyboard showcasing progressive analysis, identifying profitability drivers like product category, customer segment, and location.

## **Results & Business Recommendations**
**Business Impact:**

* The interactive Tableau dashboard highlighted profitability issues and opportunities for optimization.
* Visualizations enabled swift diagnostic analysis, supporting data-driven decision-making.

**Insights:**

* Highlighted high-performing regions and customer segments for targeted marketing efforts.
  
**Strategic Recommendations:**

* Implement a pricing strategy to optimize margins on underperforming product categories.
* Refine the promotion strategy by targeting customer segments with higher profitability potential.
* Adjust the shipping strategy for locations with high costs but low revenue generation.
  
## **Next Steps**
**Future Work:**

* Update dashboards with real-time data to track profitability trends.
